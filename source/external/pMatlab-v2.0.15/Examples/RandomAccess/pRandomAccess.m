%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% GUPS (Giga UPdates per Second) is a measurement that profiles the memory
% architecture of a system and is a measure of performance similar to MFLOPS.
% GUPS is calculated by identifying the number of memory locations that can be
% randomly updated in one second, divided by 1 billion (1e9). The term
% "randomly" means that there is little relationship between one address to be 
% updated and the next, except that they occur in the space of one half the
% total system memory.  An update is a read-modify-write operation on a table
% of 64-bit words.  An address is generated, the value at that address read from
% memory, modified by an integer operation (add, and, or, xor) with a literal
% value, and that new value is written back to memory.
%
% Parameters:
%   * PARALLEL - Turn on distributed arrays.
%
%   * VALIDATE - Enable validation of results.
%
%   * Nup - Number of updates to the table.
%
%   * ErrorRate - Allowed error rate.
%
%   * lgN - Used to set size of table, where N = 2^lgN
%
%   * lgNb - Used to set block size of generating random references
%      where Nb = 2^lgNb.
