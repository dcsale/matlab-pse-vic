=========================================================================

I. INTRODUCTION

Matlab is the dominate programming language for implementing numerical
computations and is widely used for algorithm development, simulation,
data reduction, testing and system evaluation.  Many of these computations
could benefit from faster execution on a parallel computer. There have
been many previous attempts to provide an efficient mechanism for running
Matlab programs on parallel computers.  These efforts have faced numerous
challenges and none have received widespread acceptance.

In the world of parallel computing the Message Passing Interface (MPI)
is the de facto standard for implementing programs on multiple processors.
MPI defines C and Fortran language functions for doing point-to-point
communication in a parallel program.  MPI has proven to be an effective
model for implementing parallel programs and is used by many of the world's
most demanding applications (weather modeling, weapons simulation, aircraft
design, etc.).

MatlabMPI is set of Matlab scripts that implement a subset of MPI and allow
any Matlab program to be run on a parallel computer. The key innovation of
MatlabMPI is that it implements the widely used MPI "look and feel" on top
of standard Matlab file i/o, resulting in a "pure" Matlab implementation
that is exceedingly small (~300 lines of code).  Thus, MatlabMPI will run
on any combination of computers that Matlab supports.  In addition, because
of its small size, it is simple to download and use (and modify if you like).

=========================================================================

II. REQUIREMENTS

- Matlab license

- File system visible to all processors

On shared memory systems, MatlabMPI only requires a single Matlab license
as each user is allowed to have many Matlab sessions. On distributed
memory systems, MatlabMPI will require one Matlab license per machine.
However, if your scripts are compilable with Matlab's mcc command then
you only need one license no matter what.

Because MatlabMPI uses file I/O for communication, there must be a
directory that is visible to every machine (this is usually also required
in order to install Matlab).  This directory defaults to the directory that
the program is launched from, but can be changed within the MatlabMPI
program.

=========================================================================

III. INSTALLING AND RUNNING:

1. Copy MatlabMPI into a location that is visible to all computers.

2. Add MatlabMPI/src directory to matlab path (e.g. put

      addpath ~/MatlabMPI/src

   in your matlab/startup.m file.  You may require a different path than
   the above statement, depending on where you install MatlabMPI.  For
   more information about startup.m, please refer to the Matlab documentation).

3. OPTIONAL: set rsh or ssh, set path to matlab executable (see Section
   XI - OTHER SETTINGS)

4. Type "help MatlabMPI" to get a list of all the functions.

5. Type "help function_name" to get more info on a specific function.

6. Go to the "examples" directory.

7. To run from the Matlab command line, first start Matlab then type:

      eval( MPI_Run('xbasic',     2,machines) );
      eval( MPI_Run('basic',      2,machines) );
      eval( MPI_Run('multi_basic',2,machines) );
      eval( MPI_Run('probe',      2,machines) );
      eval( MPI_Run('speedtest',  2,machines) );
      eval( MPI_Run('basic_app',  2,machines) );
      eval( MPI_Run('broadcast',  2,machines) );
      eval( MPI_Run('blurimage',  2,machines) );

   MPI_Run has three arguments: the name of the MatlabMPI program (without
   the ".m" suffix), the number of machines to run the program on and the
   "machines" argument which contains a list of names of machines on which
   to run the program.  If the user directs MPI_Run to use N machines and
   the "machines" list contains M names, where M > N, then MPI_Run will
   execute the program on the first N processors in the list.

   The "machines" argument can be of the following form:

      machines = {};
         Run on a local processor.

      machines = {'machine1' 'machine2'}) );
         Run on multiprocessors.

      machines = {'machine1:dir1' 'machine2:dir2'}) );
         Run on multiprocessors and communicate via dir1 and dir2,
         which must be visible to both machines.

8. To run using the Matlab compiler first start Matlab then type:

      eval( MPI_Run( MPI_cc('xbasic'), 2,machines) );

   or:

      MPI_cc('xbasic');
      eval( MPI_Run( 'compiled xbasic.exe'), 2,machines) );

   NOTE: The MPI_cc command will only work if you have properly configured
   your paths so that your code will compile (e.g. your LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
   etc ...), which can take a little effort.  On Linux systems you will have
   to add (at a minimum):

      matlab/extern/lib/glnx86
      matlab/bin/glnx86
      matlab/sys/os/glnx86

=========================================================================

IV. LAUNCHING AND FILE I/O

Launching from the Matlab command line using eval(MPI_Run(...)) allows
for a variety of behavior.  MPI_Run(...) does two things. First, it
launches a Matlab script on the specified machines with output redirected
to a file. Second, if the rank=0 process is being run on the local machine,
MPI_Run(...) returns a string containing the commands to initialize
MatlabMPI, which allows MatlabMPI to be invoked deep inside of any Matlab
program.

This launching and output behavior is summarized below:

   ---------------------------------------------
   Machine     MPI Rank = 0      MPI Rank > 0  
   ---------------------------------------------
   Local     exec() > screen     unix > file
   Remote       rsh > file        rsh > file
   ---------------------------------------------

The files that contain the program output are stored in the MatMPI
directory which is created by MPI_Run.  Filenames are of the form:

   program.rank.out

where "program" is the name of the MatlabMPI program and "rank" is the
rank of the MatlabMPI process that generated the output.  See ERROR
HANDLING for more information about the MatMPI directory.

=========================================================================

V. ERROR HANDLING

MatlabMPI handles errors pretty much the same as existing Matlab; however
running hundreds of copies does bring up some additional issues.

- If an error is encountered and your Matlab script has an "exit" statement
  (which it should) then all the Matlab processes should die gracefully.

- If a Matlab job is waiting for a message that will never arrive, then
  you will have to kill it by hand by starting a new Matlab session and
  typing:

     MPI_Abort

  If this doesn't work, you will need to log into each machine, type
  "top" and kill the Matlab processes one by one.

- MatlabMPI can leave a variety of files lying around, which are best
  to delete once an error has occurred by starting Matlab and typing:

     MatMPI_Delete_all

  If this doesn't work, you can delete the files by hand. The files can
  be found in two places -  the launching directory and the communication
  directory (which by default are the same place).

  In the launch directory you may have leftover files that look like:

     MatMPI/*

  In the communication directory you may have leftover files that look
  like:

     p<rank>_p<rank>_t<tag>_buffer.mat
     p<rank>_p<rank>_t<tag>_lock.mat

  It is very important that you delete these files.  In general, if you
  are using a public directory to do communication (e.g.; /tmp), you should
  create a subdirectory first (e.g.; /tmp/joe) and use this directory
  for communication.

=========================================================================

VI. RUNNING ON LINUX

- MatlabMPI now performs great on Linux clusters.  The key is changing the
  "acdirmin" parameter from 30 seconds to 0.1 seconds when you NFS mount
  the file system that is used for communication. Here is the mount command
  we found that worked well for us:

     mount -o acdirmin=0.1, \
      rw,sync,hard,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,nfsvers=2,udp \
      node-a:/export/gigabit  /wulf/gigabit

  NOTE: If you choose to set these parameters in the automounter, you MUST
  RESTART the automounter on each machine that this automount listing.

- WARNING: There is currently a bug with the Matlab GUI on Linux.  You may
  get the following error (or any other weird error):

     ??? Error using ==> mkdir
     tcsh: No entry for terminal type "'MATLAB Command Window'"tcsh: using
     dumb terminal settings.

  If you get this error, try one of the following:

  1. Run the following command and restart Matlab:

        setenv MATLAB_SHELL  /bin/sh

     If this fixes the problem, then you may want to add this line to your
     .bashrc (or equivalent dot-file if you use a different shell).

  2. If setting the MATLAB_SHELL environment variable does not fix the
     problem, try deleting your ~/.matlab directory and restart Matlab from
     the command line using the command:

        matlab -nojvm

=========================================================================

VII. RUNNING ON MacOSX

MatlabMPI works on MacOSX without modification.  Most likely you will have
to use ssh instead of rsh (see OTHER SETTINGS below).

=========================================================================

VIII. RUNNING ON PC

Installing and running MatlabMPI on a PC requires additional steps.
Please read the accompanying README.pc file.

=========================================================================

IX. OTHER OPTIMIZATIONS

- For even better performance on a cluster try the following:

  1. Put a copy of Matlab on each node and alias the 'matlab'
     command to the copy on each of the nodes.

  2. Cross-mount all the local disks so each node is receiving
     files on its own disk.

  NOTE: With these optimizations, sometimes Matlab can launch too fast
  with weird NFS errors as a result.  We are not sure of the cause, but
  we have found that removing all path statements from your .cshrc file
  can help.

- Sometimes odd behavior results when very large (~100 MByte) messages
  are used.  If you notice problems, you might try sending several smaller
  messages.

- Sometimes a large amount of NFS GETATTR traffic can be generated if
  you are waiting a long time to receive files.  You can probe this
  traffic by logging into the NFS server as root and typing
  "snoop | grep <machine-name>", and watch for "GETATTR" packets.

=========================================================================

X. RUNNING IN BATCH MODE

There are several ways to deal with batch:

1. Request an interactive queue (many systems support) this.

2. Write a matlab script that contains your MPI_Run command (e.g. RUN.m)
   and then in your batch script put the line:

      matlab -nojvm -nosplash -display null < RUN.m

   Then you can submit your batch script to a queue.

3. If you want to do things by hand.  The best way is to see what is
   going on is to launch on a non-existent machine, e.g.

      MPI_Run('xbasic',2,{'unknown'});
      Launching MPI rank: 1 on: unknown
      Launching MPI rank: 0 on: unknown
      unix_launch =
        rsh unknown -n 'cd /home/kepner/MatlabMPI/examples;
        /bin/sh ./MatMPI/Unix_Commands.unknown.0.sh &' &

   The above output lists the precise rsh command that is generated.
   You can copy and edit this command to run your program.  In addition,
   you should examine the file:

      ./MatMPI/Unix_Commands.unknown.0.sh

   This contains the matlab invocations.

=========================================================================

XI. OTHER SETTINGS

The file:

        MatlabMPI/src/MatMPI_Comm_settings.m

can be edited by users to change the behavior of MatlabMPI.  Currently,
the settings include:

   - unix vs. windows (disabled)
   - rsh vs. ssh (which method to use to launch MatlabMPI processes on
     remote machines)
   - setting the location of the matlab executable

You can either edit this file directly or copy it into the directory you
are running out of and edit it locally.

By default, MatlabMPI uses rsh.  Unfortunately, switching from rsh to ssh
requires more than just changing the machine_db_settings.remote_launch
setting.  The following procedure will allow you to use ssh without being
prompted for a password (a necessary requirement for MatlabMPI):

   1. Set machine_db_settings.remote_launch inside MatMPI_Comm_settings.m
      to ssh.

   2. Create an RSA key with the following command (accept all defaults):

         ssh-keygen -t rsa

   3. Append the RSA public key to the list of authorized key.

         cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa >> ~/.ssh/authorized_hosts

   4. Log into every machine that MatlabMPI will launch processes on and
      accept each machine's host key.

=========================================================================

XII. DIAGNOSTICS AND TROUBLESHOOTING

1. Please read the documentation.

   Please read the Section V - ERROR HANDLING and Section IX - OTHER
   OPTIMIZATIONS.

2. Make sure you can launch matlab.

   Type "which matlab" on each of the machines you are trying to run on. 
   If it says:

      matlab: Command not found

   then you need to put it in your path.  You can also hard code the path
   into MatlabMPI by editing the MatlabMPI/src/MatMPI_Comm_settings.m and
   changing the line:

      matlab_location = ' matlab ';

   Note that you still must be able to run Matlab from the shell prompt on
   the machine on which you are launching your MatlabMPI program.

3. Test that MatlabMPI is in your path.

   Start matlab and type:

      help MatlabMPI

   if you get the error:

      MatlabMPI not found

   then you need to put MatlabMPI/src in you path. See the INSTALLING
   AND RUNNING instructions in README and README.pc.

4. Starting up (xbasic script).

   Go to the MatlabMPI/src/examples directory.  Edit RUN.m so that it
   only runs the 'xbasic' script.  Also, change the machines variable so
   that MatlabMPI runs on the machines that you want. Start matlab and
   type RUN. This should run a few seconds and return 'SUCCESS'.  Quit
   matlab and look at the output of the other process, for example type:

      more MatMPI/*.out

   If it ran successfully, great.  If not, take a look at the error
   message.

5. Testing MatlabMPI

   There are man scripts in the examples directory which are useful
   for testing performance.  In this section we explaing how they can
   be used.

   a. Start up peformance (basic script)

      Repeat step 4 with the 'basic' script.  'basic' sends a message
      between two processors. If it hangs, kill matlab and look at the
      output.  If it runs successfully, run it a few times and note the
      runtimes.  The first time may take 20 seconds, subsequent times
      should take ~2 seconds.  If it takes a lot longer, Matlab may be
      taking a long time to launch on remote machines.  There are two
      likely causes.

      The first is that sometimes your $PATH variable can take a long time
      to evaluate.  Comment out various environment variables and see if it
      affects performance.

      The second is the latency in launching Matlab.  This latency can
      sometimes be alleviated by installing a local copy of Matlab on each
      machine so it doesn't have to be sent over your network.

   b. Messaging peformance (multi_basic script)

      Repeat step 4 with the 'multi_basic'.  'multi_basic' sends several
      messages between two processors.  It is very useful for debugging
      performance problems that can occur when you cross-mount file systems
      to achieve better messaging performance. If multi_basic runs
      successfully, run it a few times and note the runtimes.  The first time
      may take 20 seconds, subsequent times should take ~2 seconds.  If it
      takes a lot longer and you notice lots of times around integer seconds
      (e.g. 1 second, 2 seconds, 30 seconds), then this most likely means
      that there are some lags in updating the cache on your filesystem.
      This is particularly common in Linux.  See Section VI - RUNNING ON
      LINUX for good ways to mount the file system.

   c. High peformance messaging (speedtest script)

      Repeat step 4 with the 'speedtest' script.  'speedtest' sends many
      messages of increasing size between two (or more) processors.  It is
      very useful for testing the limits of your filesystem.  It might take
      several minutes to run.  After it has run, type:

         total_time

      You will see a listing of the times it took to send all the messages.
      These should start with small numbers (~50 millesconds) and eventually
      get up to around 1 second or more.  Next type:

         bandwidth

      This is the simultaneous bandwidth between the two processors. It
      should start out small, and then grow to around 10 Megabytes/second or
      greater. You should also look at the results of speedtest from other
      processors which are saved in speedtest.1.mat, ...

   d. High Performance computation (blurimage script)

      Repeat the procedure in Step 4 with the 'blurimage' script. This
      filters an image and reports the performance in Gigaflops.
      It is a good test of performance.

   e. Testing everything (unit_test_all)

      Edit the unit_test_all script to run on the machines you want (be
      sure and remember the "&" for the first machine).  This script will
      test everything.  It can take a while.  There is also a similar script
      called unit_test_all_mcc, which tests all the scripts with the compiler
      command (MPI_cc).

6. Testing your own program.

   Hopefully the above scripts will give you some insight into how to make
   your own program run better.  Here are some more specific instructions.

   a. Timing

      Time the part of the program you want to run in parallel. Rememember
      that MatlabMPI only can improve this part of the program.  Furthermore,
      as the parallel part runs faster, the non-parallel part will start
      dominating the overalltime (a.k.a. Amdahl's law).

      Note that while parallization can reduce computation time, it adds
      overhead due to sending messages.  Compare the times you get for your
      messages with times in speedtest.  You should also time how long it
      takes to send messages in your program.  If your program spends too
      much time performing communication, your program may not benefit from
      the reduced time in computation.  Which leads us to the next section...

   b. General Tuning

      Minimize communication.  Try and do as much computation as you can
      without sending messages.  Also, it is much much better to send a few
      big messages than many little messages.

      You should try and divide the work among the different processors so
      that it is even as possible (this is called Load Balancing).  If the
      workload varies as a function of the data, than you might want to set
      up a client/server model that deals out work on an as needed basis.

      Avoid restart.  You can start MatlabMPI anywhere in your program,
      however you should also avoid restarting MatlabMPI in your program.

=========================================================================

XIII. FIRST-TIME USER'S RULES OF THUMB

Thanks to Theresa Meuse for starting this section.

- Delete stale copies of the MatMPI directory prior to launching your program.
  See the next item for more details.

- Use the RUN.m script included in the examples directory to run your program.
  RUN.m kills stale Matlab processes leftover from a prior MatlabMPI program,
  removes the MatMPI directory, then launches your program.

- Make sure the directory containing a MatlabMPI program is not write-
  protected; MatlabMPI needs to create and write to the MatMPI directory.
  In Windows, we have seen directories become write-protected when stepping
  through a MatlabMPI program with the Matlab debugger without completing
  execution.

- Make sure that when installing a new version of MatlabMPI that all source
  code from the old version is deleted or that your path points to only the
  new version.  Make sure that there are no copies of any old MatlabMPI source
  code in your current working directory.  This leads us to the next point:

- Don't change the directory structure of MatlabMPI.  To quote the old adage:
  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  Changing the directory structure may
  inadvertantly lead your application to behave differently than expected.

- Make sure your application does not use "clear" or "clear all" at any point
  within your MatlabMPI code.  When you run:

     eval( MPI_Run('...', ..., ...) );

  a global variable called MPI_COMM_WORLD is created.  Almost all the MPI
  functions require the information contained in MPI_COMM_WORLD.

- Make sure that your application does not change its working directory during
  execution.  Otherwise, MatlabMPI cannot find/access the MatMPI directory.

- Tag management is crucial.  Take care when creating and managing tag values.

- READ SECTION XII - DIAGNOSTICS AND TROUBLESHOOTING.  Start with the examples
  and be able to execute them on your local machine only.  Then get the
  examples working on multiple machines.  Then develop an example for yourself.

- Exiting and restarting Matlab between runs of MatlabMPI programs can improve
  performance.  Restarting Matlab performs a number of tasks, e.g. clearing
  out memory, closing file, etc., that can potentially improve performance of
  MatlabMPI programs running in a new instance of Matlab.
