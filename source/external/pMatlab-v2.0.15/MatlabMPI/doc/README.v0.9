WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 0.9

-Completely reworked underlying infrastructure to add
 a host of new features such as MPI_Abort and MatMPI_Delete_all.

-Can now have different communication directories for each node,
 for example:

        MPI_Run('myscript',2,{'machine1:dir1' 'machine2:dir2'} )

-Added MPI_Probe command to check for incoming messages.
