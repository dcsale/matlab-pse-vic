function r = power(p,q)
% .^  Array power.
%     R = P .^ Q or R = POWER(P, Q) performs an element-wise power operation
%     between P and Q.  If both P and Q are DMATs, then their dimensions and
%     maps must be equal.  If only one of P and Q is a DMAT, then their
%     dimensions must be the same or the non-DMAT input must be a scalar.
%     DMAT inputs can only be scalar if both inputs are DMATs and have the
%     same map.
