%RECONSTRUCT Given collected distributed data in grid layout, reconstructs
%   the original object according to data distribution. If the original
%   distribution was BLOCK, the grid layout is the original layout.
%
%   Also returns reconstructed matrix in the same format as the distributed
%   matrix, i.e. full distributed matrices are returned as full matrices
%   and sparse distributed matrices are returned as sparse matrices.
%
%       MAT_SIZE is the array describing the dimensions of the distributed
%       object.
