         <p>Linearity in gray is important for a colormap to look reasonable when printed in grayscale ("black and white"), but note that
            precise linearity depends on the particular (non-unique) choice for conversion from RGB values to grayscale brightness/luminance,
            which would ideally be (printing-) device-dependent in this context, and using ICC color profiles, etc. In practice, we use
            a simpler conversion, like rgb2gray, (see code comments in colormap_optimization for further details).
         </p>
         <p>We explore a range of template colormaps, but note that others could be better still... In particular, a colormap "dusk" has
            recently been added to real2rgb (see below), which I have not had time to investigate... Another area for future work would
            be a CIELAB-based investigation, see:
