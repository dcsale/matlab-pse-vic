%% Find a bipolar colormap, linear in grayscale, close to a template map.

%%
% Linearity in gray is important for a colormap to look reasonable when
% printed in grayscale ("black and white"), but note that precise linearity 
% depends on the particular (non-unique) choice for conversion from RGB 
% values to grayscale brightness/luminance, which would ideally be 
% (printing-) device-dependent in this context, and using ICC color
% profiles, etc. In practice, we use a simpler conversion, like rgb2gray,
% (see code comments in colormap_optimization for further details).

%%
% We explore a range of template colormaps, but note that others could be
% better still... In particular, a colormap "dusk" has recently been added
% to real2rgb (see below), which I have not had time to investigate...
% Another area for future work would be a CIELAB-based investigation, see:

%%
% I think this is a really nice bipolar colormap. My only minor quibble
% is that the off-white and off-black ends are not very appealing (to me).
% Note that they are pure white and pure black in Oliver's original thermal
% scheme, but I don't like that, since I want hardcopy to be distinguished
% from any black lines or text labels and from a white background.

%% Based on my adaption of Brewer's (1996) recommendations
% with a neutral central colour, and two colours on each side, which I feel
% better discriminates between values within each of the two halves.
% Brewer (1996) considers issues such as colorblindness, etc. She
% recommends (separately) blue-red and purple-yellow schemes (but not
% blue-purple or red-yellow). The following seems like a reasonable
% compromise given that Brewer's table 2 shows no ideal paths through four
% colors (only a few ideal color-pairs, which sadly cannot be linked up).

% I am probably biased, but I think the two-color transitions here are
% helpful, and there is reasonable (though not perfect) perceptual symmetry
% between the orange-yellow and blue-purple transitions (if anything, the
% purple transitions a little too sharply near the end, around -0.95). It
% could undoubtedly be improved further, but seems good enough to me...
