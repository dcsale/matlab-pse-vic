Installation
============

This tutorial will walk you through the process of installing PyVisfile. If
you'd like to only use PyVisfile's Vtk writing capability, you may skip to
:ref:`download-and-unpack`.  If you'd also like to write Silo files, you need
to follow the entire set of instructions.

To follow, you really only need three basic things:

* A UNIX-like machine with web access.
* A C++ compiler, preferably a Version 4.x gcc.
* A working `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ installation, Version 2.4 or newer.

You may adapt the file and directory names in this tutorial to suit
your liking, just be sure to be consistent in your changes.

.. note:: 

    Whenever you see the "`$`" dollar sign in this tutorial, this
    means you should enter the subsequent text at your shell prompt.
    You don't have to be `root`. A few spots are marked with "sudo" to
    show that these *do* require root privileges *if* you are using a
    Python interpreter that is installed globally.

With Silo capability
--------------------

Step 1: Install :mod:`pyublas`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    If you have already installed :mod:`hedge`, then you automatically
    also already have :mod:`pyublas`, and you can skip this step.

The first step in this installation is to install PyUblas. To achieve
this, please follow `PyUblas's installation instructions
<http://documen.tician.de/pyublas/installing.html>`_.

Step 2: Download and build libsilo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the `Silo source code
<https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/silo/downloads.html>`_, version 4.6.1 or
newer. Then unpack, build and install it::

    $ tar xfz ~/download/silo-N.N.N.tar.gz
    $ cd silo-N.N.N
    $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/pool --enable-shared=yes --enable-static=no
    $ make install

Step 3: Update your build configuration file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During prior steps of this installation, you will have created
a file called :file:`.aksetup-defaults.py`  in your home directory. 
Now add the following lines to this file::

    SILO_INC_DIR = ['${HOME}/pool/include']
    SILO_LIB_DIR = ['${HOME}/pool/lib']

You will need to adapt the above path names to the location where you installed 
the Silo software, of course.

.. note::

    Make sure not to miss the initial dot in the configuration file name, 
    it's important.

.. note::

    The order of the entries in the build configuration file does not
    matter.

.. _download-and-unpack:

Common installation
-------------------

Step 4: Download and unpack PyVisfile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Download PyVisfile <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvisfile>`_ and unpack it::

    $ tar xfz pyvisfile-VERSION.tar.gz

Step 5: Build :mod:`pyvisfile`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just type::

    $ cd pyvisfile-VERSION # if you're not there already
    $ sudo python setup.py install

Once that works, congratulations! You've successfully built :mod:`pyvisfile`.
