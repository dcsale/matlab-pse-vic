WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 0.3

-MatlabMPI now performs great on Linux clusters.  The key is
 changing the "acdirmin" parameter from 30 to 0.1 when you
 NFS mount the filesystem that is used for communication.
 Here is the mount command we found that worked well for us:

   mount -o acdirmin=0.1,rw,sync,hard,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,nfsvers=2,udp \
   node-a:/export/gigabit  /wulf/gigabit

-Several minor changes/additions in examples/ directory:
    xbasic.m        eXtreme basic, just prints rank.
    basic.m         Now prints "SUCCESS" when it has completed.
    multi_basic.m   Runs multiple sends and recieves and times them.
    blurimage.m     Now prints out the Gigaflops that were achieved.

-MatlabMPI has been tested on SGI IRIX, Sun Solaris, IBM AIX,
 HP-UX, Linux and Windows.  It should run everywhere Matlab runs.
 To run in NT currently requires launching  each Matlab session by hand.

-MatlabMPI has been benchmarked on SGI, Sun, HP, IBM and Intel
 systems and achieves expected hardware limits with the exception of
 Linux due to the poor implementation of NFS in Linux.  This problem is
 currently being addressed by the Linux community.
