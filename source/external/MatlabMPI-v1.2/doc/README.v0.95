WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 0.9x

-Added documentation.  Typing "help MatlabMPI" produces
 a list of all the functions in the library. Typing
 "help function_name" gives info on the function.

-Added MatMPI_Comm_settings which allow users to customize
 internals of MatlabMPI operation (rsh vs. ssh, ...).

-Added unit_test and unit_test_all scripts to do automatic
 regression testing.

-Added MatMPI_Save_messages which prevents messages from being
 deleted (useful for debugging, also useful to accelerate
 MPI_Bcast).
