WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 0.2

-The "matlab_mpirun" Bourne shell script has now been replaced with
 the MPI_Run matlab command, which allows starting MatlabMPI
 at *any* point deep inside in a Matlab program.  This also
 makes it much easier to run MatlabMPI interactively and on non-Unix machines.

-Send and receive multiple variables.  Can now send and receive an arbitrary
 number of variables.

-Added MPI_Bcast.  MPI_Bcast has been added and uses symbolic links
 to minimizes the amount of traffic.

-Added "profiles".  All MatlabMPI functions will now be part of either
 the "Core Lite", "Core" or "Core Plus" profiles.

-Using MatlabMPI with ssh and ssh2 instead of rsh has been demonstrated
 at Ohio State University (Thanks!).  This will be incorporated in
 at a late date once the Windows remote launching mechanism has been
 figured out.  For now, to use ssh/ssh2 do the following:
  (1) Setup up ssh so that it does not require passwords.
  (2) Edit the last line of src/MatMPI_Launch.m to use ssh or ssh2.

-MatlabMPI has been tested on SGI IRIX, Sun Solaris, AIX,
 HP-UX, Linux and Windows.  It should run everywhere Matlab runs.
 To run in NT currently requires launching  each Matlab session by hand.

-MatlabMPI has been benchmarked on SGI, Sun, HP, IBM and Intel
 systems and achieves expected hardware limits with the exception of
 Linux due to the poor implementation of NFS in Linux.  This problem is
 currently being addressed by the Linux community.
