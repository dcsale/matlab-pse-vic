  The true costs of high performance computing are currently dominated
by software.  Addressing these costs requires shifting to high
productivity languages such as Matlab.  MatlabMPI is a Matlab
implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard and
allows any Matlab program to exploit multiple processors.  The
performance has been tested on both shared and distributed memory
parallel computers (Sun, SGI, HP, IBM and Linux).  A test image
filtering application using MatlabMPI achieved a speedup of $\sim$300
using 304 CPUs and $\sim$15\% of the theoretical peak (450 Gigaflops)
on an IBM SP2 at the Maui High Performance Computing Center.  In
addition, this entire parallel benchmark application was implemented
in 70 software-lines-of-code (SLOC) yielding 0.85 Gigaflop/SLOC or 4.4
CPUs/SLOC.  The MatlabMPI software will be available for download at
hpcmo.hpc.mil.

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  Matlab \cite{Matlab} is the dominant programming language for
implementing numerical computations and is widely used for algorithm
development, simulation, data reduction, testing and system
evaluation.  The popularity of Matlab is driven by the high
productivity that is achieved by users because one line of Matlab code
can typically replace ten lines of C or Fortran code.  Many Matlab
programs can benefit from faster execution on a parallel computer and
there have been many previous attempts to provide an efficient
mechanism for running Matlab programs on parallel computers (see
\cite{Choy} for a complete list of these efforts).

  The Message Passing Interface (MPI) \cite{MPI} is the de facto
standard for implementing programs on multiple processors.
MatlabMPI\cite{Kepner2001} consists of a set of Matlab scripts that
implements a subset of MPI and allows any Matlab program to be run on
a parallel computer.  The key innovation of MatlabMPI is that it
implements the widely used MPI ``look and feel'' on top of standard
Matlab file I/O, resulting in a ``pure'' Matlab implementation that is
exceedingly small ($\sim$250 lines of code). Thus, MatlabMPI will run
on any combination of computers that Matlab supports.

\section{Bandwidth and Scalability Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  MatlabMPI has been run on Sun, HP, IBM, SGI and Linux platforms.
These results indicate that for large messages ($\sim$1 MByte)
MatlabMPI is able to match the performance of C MPI \cite{Kepner2001}.
In addition, MatlabMPI performance scales well to multiple processors
(see Figure~\ref{fig:Linux_bandwidth}).

\caption{ {\bf Bandwidth on a Linux Cluster.}

connected with Gigabit ethernet.
}
\label{fig:Linux_bandwidth}
\end{figure}

  To further test the scalability of MatlabMPI a simple image filtering
application based on the key
computations used in many DoD sensor processing
applications (e.g. wide area Synthetic Aperture Radar).  The image
processing application was run with a constant load per processor
(1024 x 1024 image per processor) on a large shared/distributed memory
system (the IBM SP2 at the Maui High Performance Computing Center).
In this test, the application achieved a speedup of $\sim$300 on 304
CPUs as well achieving $\sim$15\% of the theoretical peak (450
Gigaflops) of the system (see Figure~\ref{fig:MHPCC_IBMSP2_speedup}).
\begin{figure}[tbh]

\caption{ {\bf Shared/Distributed Parallel Speedup.}

application.
}
\label{fig:MHPCC_IBMSP2_speedup}
\end{figure}

  The ultimate goal of running Matlab on parallel computers is to
increase programmer productivity and decrease the large software cost
of using HPC systems.  Figure~\ref{fig:Prod_vs_Perf} plots the
software cost (measured in Software Lines of Code or SLOCs) as a
function of the maximum achieved performance (measured in units of
single processor peak) for the same image filtering application
implemented using several different libraries and languages (VSIPL,
MPI, OpenMP, using C++, C, and Matlab \cite{Kepner2002}).  These data
show that higher level languages require fewer lines to implement the
same level of functionality.  Obtaining increased peak performance
(i.e. exploiting more parallelism) requires more lines of code.
MatlabMPI is unique in that it achieves a high peak performance using
a small number of lines of code.

\begin{figure}[tbh]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{Prod_vs_Perf}}
\caption{ {\bf Productivity vs Performance.}
  Lines of code as a function of maximum achieved performance (measured
in units of single processor theoretical peak) for different
implementations of the same image filtering application.
}
\label{fig:Prod_vs_Perf}
\end{figure}

  Two useful metrics we have developed for measuring software
productivity on high performance parallel systems are Gigaflops/SLOC
and CPUs/SLOC.  The test application does extremely well in both of
these measures, achieving 0.85 Gigaflops/SLOC and 4.4 CPUs/SLOC.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  MatlabMPI provides the highest productivity parallel computing
environment available.  However, because it is a point-to-point
messaging library, a significant amount code must be added to any
application in order to do basic parallel operations.  In the test
application presented here, the number of lines of Matlab code
increased from 35 to 70.  While a 70 line parallel program is
extremely small, it represents a significant increase over the single
processor case.  Our future work will aim at creating higher level
objects (e.g. distributed matrices) that will eliminate this parallel
coding overhead.  The resulting ``Parallel Matlab Toolbox'' will be
built on top of the MatlabMPI communication layer, and will allow a
user to achieve good parallel performance without increasing the
number lines of code.
