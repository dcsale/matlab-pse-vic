%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic example of a typical application for which 
% MatlabMPI might be used.  It uses a leader that manages, 
% and workers that conduct the processing. This example 
% takes a matrix, breaks it up among processors, does a 
% computation, and gathers the results to display in a 
% figure window.
%
% This example is different from basic_app, basic_app2, 
% and basic_app3 in that the leader uses the MPI_Probe 
% function to determine whether a worker process has 
% sent a completed computation packet. The leader sends 
% a packet to be processed and then probes for a packet 
% that was sent to itself. If a packet has 
% been sent back, the leader processes the packet; if no 
% packet has been sent, then the leader proceeds to 
% sending another packet to be processed. If no other 
% packets to be processed need to be sent, then it loops 
% waiting to receive a processed packet. 
%
% This example can also plot the data on a graph figure. 
% To enable this feature, set the variable UseGraphics 
% equal to 1. 
%
% This special profiling version includes calls to Matlab's 
% profiling functions so that operation call profiles 
% can be generated for each process of Matlab on which 
% a segment of the application is run. The key lines for 
% the profiling are 53-54, 92-96, 205-210, and 217-227. 
%
%
% To run, start Matlab and type:
%
%   eval( MPI_Run('basic_app4',4,{}) );
%
% Or, to run a different machine type:
%
%   eval( MPI_Run('basic_app4',4,{'machine1' 'machine2' 'machine3' 'machine4'}) );
%
% Output will be piped into 4 files:
%
%   MatMPI/basic_app4.0.out
%   MatMPI/basic_app4.1.out
%   MatMPI/basic_app4.2.out
%   MatMPI/basic_app4.3.out
