% Basic Matlab MPI script that
% sends a matrix to another processor.
%
% To run, start Matlab and type:
%
%   eval( MPI_Run('basic',2,{}) );
%
% Or, to run a different machine type:
%
%   eval( MPI_Run('basic',2,{'machine1' 'machine2'}) );
%
% Output will be piped into two files:
%
%   MatMPI/basic.0.out
%   MatMPI/basic.1.out
