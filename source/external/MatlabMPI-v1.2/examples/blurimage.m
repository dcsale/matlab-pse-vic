% This script implements a basic image convolution
% across multiple processors.
% To run, start Matlab and type:
%
%   eval( MPI_Run('blurimage',2,{}) );
%
% Or, to run a different machine type:
%
%   eval( MPI_Run('blurimage',2,{'machine1' 'machine2'}) );
%
% Output will be piped into to
%
%   MatMPI/blurimage.0.out
%   MatMPI/blurimage.1.out
